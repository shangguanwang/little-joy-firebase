A native mobile app that lets users

<li>see other users' real-time inputs from the database <li>click heart button once if they like the site
</ol>

### Description:
🛠️ <b>Tools and languages used</b>: Firebase, HTML, CSS, JavaScript
<br>
🤔 <b>Why I want to create this project</b>: If you are like me who are very future-driven and goal-oriented, you tend to focus on the big picture and sometimes can feel discontent about the present. This app is designed to remind us the little joy we experience every day, while we are busy accomplishing the huge milestones in life, don't forget to give yourself a cheerup😊
<br>
💆‍♀️ <b>Challenges I Faced</b>: The biggest challenge is to make sure the app sends and fetches data from the database correctly. Another valuable lesson learned is to improve user experience. For instance, we want to clear the input box every time a user hit "Publish" so they don't have to do it themselves. We also want the latest posts sit at the top so the user doesn't have to scroll all the way to the bottom. A user should only be able to click the heart like icon once per session. A user should not have the ability to select any element on the page.

📕 <b>Learning resources</b>: I want to thank Rafid Hoda for his amazing Scrimba's course <a href="https://scrimba.com/learn/firebase" target="_blank">Building a Mobile App with Firebase</a> which sets the foundation really well.
